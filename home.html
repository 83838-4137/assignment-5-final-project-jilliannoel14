    <h2>Why Shop Here</h2>
     <div class="paragraph">
       <p>Unlike other floral shops, Rebloom's only grows flowers within the U.S. which last longer because they’re locally grown. We pride ourselves on protecting not only our environment but the people within our communities directly impacted by our shop locations and products. We treat our customers with the same love and care that we give our products. Reducing your carbon footprint can go a long way with the purchase of a single flower. Be apart of making a difference.</p>

    <h2>Meet the Founder</h2>
     <div class="paragraph">
       <p>Leslie Miller started out loving to pick flowers from a young age to eventually buying them often at her local grocery store.  An avid environmentalist, she started experimenting once the flowers died by drying them out to create extravagant bouquets, candles, and artwork. Passionate to keep the world as eco friendly as possible, she opened Reblooms to honor our beautiful green world and make the most of each flower no matter its stage of life.</p>
