    <h2>Meet the Founder</h2>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>Leslie Miller started out loving to pick flowers from a young age to eventually buying them often at her local grocery store. An avid environmentalist, she started experimenting once the flowers died by drying them out to create extravagant bouquets, candles, and artwork. Passionate to keep the world as eco-friendly as possible, she opened Reblooms to honor our beautiful green world and make the most of each flower no matter its stage of life.</p>
